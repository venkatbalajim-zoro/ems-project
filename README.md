# Employee Management System

## Overview

This is a backend project built to learn the Go programming language. It manages employees and departments using a simple microservices setup.


## Key Features

- **Microservices Architecture** – Each service handles a specific part of the system.
- **Gin Framework** – Fast and easy routing and logging.
- **MySQL** – Used as the main database.
- **GORM** – ORM library for easy database interaction.
- **JWT Authentication** – Secures routes with token-based login.
- **CRUD Operations** – Create, read, update, and delete employees and departments.
- **Middleware** - JWT auth token verification. 
- **gRPC Communication** - Intercommunication between services for token verification. 


## Future Plans

- Reading CSV file for adding and updating multiple records of data. 
- Use Go concurrency to improve performance.
- Advanced logging for debugging and monitoring API requests. 
- Testing and benchmarking in all modules. 
- Build a simple frontend UI for users.


## Project Goals

This project is designed to:

- Help me practice Go for backend development.
- Understand how microservices work.
- Learn how to build secure and scalable APIs.
